# Demo Client

This client assembly is source-controlled reference content for local validation.

Run it through Docker Compose from this directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
pnpm dev
```

The development stack starts Postgres, migrates the database with the one-shot `migrate` service, then starts the API, the UI, the artifact preview worker and the workspace command worker. The API listens on `http://127.0.0.1:4100`, and the UI listens on `http://127.0.0.1:5173`.

## Execution Workspaces and Pages

The demo runs with Execution Workspaces and the `apps` module on. Its agent reads and writes files in the workspace of a conversation, runs commands there and saves a Page with `page.save`.

- Commands and Page builds run in the Docker sandbox. The service `workspace-command-runner` builds the runner image (`vivd-catalyst-demo-workspace-command-runner:local`) and the service `workspace-command-worker` starts one container per command through the Docker socket of the host. The first build of the runner image takes several minutes.
- The worker keeps the directory of a running command under `/tmp/vivd-catalyst-demo-execution-workspaces` on the host. `WORKSPACE_COMMAND_HOST_ROOT` names another directory; Docker must be allowed to mount it.
- The runner image is the platform's own. It has Python with `openpyxl`, `python-docx`, `python-pptx` and `pypdf`, LibreOffice and the Page build command, and none of the artifact helper commands of the capabilities repository, so the demo ships no spreadsheet, document, presentation or PDF skills.

## Agent and skill configuration

Agents and skills are loaded live from the database. The YAML and Markdown files under `agents/` and `skills/` are the CLI working copy, not runtime file config: a change to them, such as a new entry under `toolNames`, reaches a running demo only with `pnpm config:push`, and a database that was never pushed to has no agent. On the first boot, and after every change to the working copy, start the API and then push that working copy from another terminal:

```bash
pnpm seed:auth
pnpm config:local-key
pnpm config:push
```

`pnpm config:local-key` signs in as the seeded demo superadmin, creates the service principal `Local config CLI` with `config_assets.read` and `config_assets.release` and a key limited to `config_assets:read` and `config_assets:release`, and writes the key into the gitignored `.env` as `CATALYST_API_KEY` without printing it. Run it again after every database reset. It works only against `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `::1` and only with a development config; on any other instance, create the principal and key by hand under Administration > API Access.

`pnpm config:push` builds the config CLI and loads `.env`. The key is exchanged for a short-lived access token; it is not written to `catalyst.yaml` or `.catalyst-state.json`. It pushes with `--force`, so it replaces what was changed in the interface since the last push; `pnpm config:diff` shows the difference first.

The workflow assistant can propose changes to its shared instructions with
`propose_skill_change`, including new instructions. Ask it to remember a general
rule, then review the proposal in **Freigaben**. Approval requires
`agent_skills.approve` (admins by default, grantable per user in user
administration). The `no_personal_data` approval check uses `guardrailCheck`
(OpenAI `gpt-5-nano`), the same provider and model as conversation titles; a
failed check warns the approver. Approved changes live in the database; pull
before editing the working copy to preserve them.

The CLI signs in with `CATALYST_API_KEY` only. `CHAT_SERVER_CREDENTIAL` is a separate API-side setting for embedded chat session issuance and the CLI does not read it.

For the production-style Compose stack, copy `.env.prod.example` to `.env.prod`, replace every placeholder secret, then run:

```bash
pnpm prod:config
pnpm dev:prod
```

The production-style stack runs migrations as a one-shot job before starting the API. Caddy is the public front door on `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default and proxies API/auth routes to the API while serving the static UI through the UI container.

It registers example tools, including `demo.weather_forecast` and `demo.workflow_summary`.
The weather tool returns `display.kind: "weather.forecast"`, and the demo UI registers
`demoDisplayWidgets` from `widgets/` to render that output.

To exercise the tool path locally, ask for a forecast such as:

```text
Check the weather forecast for Oslo for the next three days.
```
